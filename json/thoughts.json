Iâ€™m watching a documentary about the pixies. A YouTube video essay really. Black Francis explains his lyric writing process as listening to the chord progression and hearing five words. Five words might mean something. The lines before and after might mean something else. I am crying because 1. I love the pixies 2. I am NOT a lyrics guy. Music is about vibes and the instrumental music. And I suspect a lot of lyrics has very little actual meaning to the artist in popular music. We hear what we want, because the devil is six, and if the devil is six, then god is seven; this monkeys gone to heaven"
